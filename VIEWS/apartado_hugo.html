           <p class="parrafo">
                As I already mentioned, I was born in Tabasco, where I spent half of my life.
                My dadâ€™s name is Victor Cano, and my momâ€™s name is MarÃ­a JesÃºs. They always taught me
                good manners.
            </p>
           <p class="parrafo">
                When I was 5 years old, I got my first puppy.
                When I was 4 years old, I started preschool.

            <p class="parrafo">
                When I was 11 years old, I was on a volleyball team, and we won a championship. <br>
                I have liked sports since I was little.

            <h3 class="parrafo">Math & Robots</h3>
            <p class="parrafo">
                In middle school and high school, I was one of the best students in math classes. <br>
                At the end of high school, I charged my classmates for doing their homework.

            <h3 class="parrafo">COVID-19 Time</h3>
            <p class="parrafo">
                During the pandemic, I discovered my passionate interest in technology, video games, and music. <br>
                I got sick with COVID-19, and despite not having any vaccine, the illness did not worsen.

            <h3 class="parrafo">High School</h3>
            <p class="parrafo">
                During high school, I was a calm and focused young person. My faith always kept me
                grounded and guided my decisions and actions. I was always diligent and responsible,
                consistently applying myself to my studies and respecting those around me.
